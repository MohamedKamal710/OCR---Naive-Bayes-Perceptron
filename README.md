# OCR---Naive-Bayes & Perceptron
#### This is an implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Naive Bayes & Perceptron algorithms.


Images are 28 x 28 array, which every cell (pixel) could be 0 (White pixel) or 1 (Black pixel).
0 is presented as ' ' (space) and 1 is presented as '#' or '+'
For example:
